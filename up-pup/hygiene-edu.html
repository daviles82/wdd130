                    Here on the On The Pup & Up, we offer a different type of service. One that considers your pet’s
                    custom
                    needs. Most other grooming services are timed crunch that will not consider if your pet is having
                    trouble with their groom. Grooming service for a dog could be terrifying at times, we gently love
                    and care for your pup while in our care.

                    Parasites: FLEAS, TICKS, & MITES OH MY! If a pet is not on prevention it’s more likely that the pet
                    will
                    have parasites. These creatures don’t just cause itching, they can also spread diseases, cause
                    anemia,
                    and cause severe hair loss and skin sensitivity in your fur baby. Not to mention, these buggers are
                    zoonotic, which means that they can feed on you too. YIKES!

                    Tooth Decay/Gum Disease: Dogs and cats have teeth just like we do, and just like us they need to be
                    cared for often. Teeth brushing and yearly cleanings are a must for your pet’s teeth. If their teeth
                    and
                    gums are not cared for it can lead to plaque, cavities, tooth loss, gum disease and bone loss. Bad
                    teeth
                    and gums can also affect the cardio vascular system.
