                Here on the On The Pup & Up, we offer a different type of service. One that considers your pet’s custom

                Parasites: FLEAS, TICKS, & MITES OH MY! If a pet is not on prevention it’s more likely that the pet will
                have parasites. These creatures don’t just cause itching, they can also spread diseases, cause anemia,
                and cause severe hair loss and skin sensitivity in your fur baby. Not to mention, these buggers are
                zoonotic, which means that they can feed on you too. YIKES!

                Tooth Decay/Gum Disease: Dogs and cats have teeth just like we do, and just like us they need to be
                cared for often. Teeth brushing and yearly cleanings are a must for your pet’s teeth. If their teeth and
                gums are not cared for it can lead to plaque, cavities, tooth loss, gum disease and bone loss. Bad teeth
                and gums can also affect the cardio vascular system.
