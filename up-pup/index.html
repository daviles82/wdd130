                    At On The Pup & Up, we want to ensure that your pet’s grooming needs are on the up & up. We take our
                    time to ensure that each pet has a pawsitive spa day, by scheduling one on one bonding time between
                    your pet and their groomer before and after their grooming sessions. We believe trust between pet
                    and groomer to be essential. We also use top of the line products to ensure your fur-baby’s skin &
                    coat feel great and stay healthy. We take pride in our AKC S.A.F.E certified and Pet CPR certified
                    staff. Not only are we safe and skilled, we are passionate about the health of your pet’s skin and
                    coat, and getting them to look and feel their absolute best.

                    Did you know that grooming isn’t only about looking good, it’s a matter of health? At On The Pup &
                    Up, we use the S.C.E.N.T (Skin, Coat, Ears & Eyes, Nails, and Teeth) method to check your dog in
                    before the appointment. This gives the groomer and the pet parent a good starting point regarding
                    the custom care your pet will be receiving. We’ll go over everything we see before and during the
                    appointment and keep you in the loop during the process. You might be asking, “what would a groomer
                    see on a dog besides fur?” Great question! The typical things groomers will find are:

                    Tooth Decay/Gum Disease: Dogs and cats have teeth just like we do, and just like us they need to be
                    cared for often. Teeth brushing and yearly cleanings are a must for your pet’s teeth. If their teeth
                    and gums are not cared for it can lead to plaque, cavities, tooth loss, gum disease and bone loss.
                    Bad teeth and gums can also affect the cardio vascular system.
