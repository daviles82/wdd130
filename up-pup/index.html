            <p>
                At On The Pup & Up, we want to ensure that your pet’s grooming needs are on the up & up. We take our
                time to ensure that each pet has a pawsitive spa day, by scheduling one on one bonding time between your
                pet and their groomer before and after their grooming sessions. We believe trust between pet and groomer
                to be essential. We also use top of the line products to ensure your fur-baby’s skin & coat feel great
                and stay healthy. We take pride in our AKC S.A.F.E certified and Pet CPR certified staff. Not only are
                we safe and skilled, we are passionate about the health of your pet’s skin and coat, and getting them to
                look and feel their absolute best. We want what’s best for fido. After all it’s our business. Still have
                questions? Great! We’ve got answers. Head on over to our FAQ page for more info on our grooming process.

                needs. Most other grooming services are timed crunch that will not consider if your pet is having

                Did you know that grooming isn’t only about looking good, it’s a matter of health? At On The Pup & Up,
                we use the S.C.E.N.T (Skin, Coat, Ears & Eyes, Nails, and Teeth) method to check your dog in before the
                appointment. This gives the groomer and the pet parent a good starting point regarding the custom care
                your pet will be receiving. We’ll go over everything we see before and during the appointment and keep
